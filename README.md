I completed the extra credit opportunity and have it properly working. One thing I did a little different for when doing a dragover between 2 cards is that instead of just creating an empty white space, I filled the gap with a more transparent version of the card being dragged (almost as if to simulate what the column would look like if the card were to be dropped between two other cards). This implementation still makes a big enough space between two standing cards for the new card to be potentially dropped in. 

I have an eslint issue only in index.js when initializing the App() class. I didn't add any default cards, which is why I'm having the issue. 

I realize I didn't properly implement the edit description part of project 2. I didn't change the implementation since it doesn't seem like we are going to be graded on this part. However, I've correctly implemented the most updated description from localstorage (when refreshing page/reloading browser).
